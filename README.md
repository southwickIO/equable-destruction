## Overview
### This app is under development.
 Evercookie related research and scripts to find evercookies.
<br>

Research was framed around [OP's creation](https://github.com/samyk/evercookie).
<br>

E(FindSessionStorage.py) ----> H[SpreadsheetHandler.py]
F(FindLocalStorage.py) ----> H[SpreadsheetHandler.py]


```

## Script Descriptions
 1. FindHTMLCookies.py - Checks for simple HTML cookies from Chrome and Firefox. Apt and Snap examples.
 2. LocalShareObjectFinder.py - Checks for the presence of LSOs, but doesnt print to spreadsheet since LSOs are deprecated.
 3. FindIsolatedStorage.py - Supposed to check for the presense of Isolated Storage. It was a Silverlight feature and there is no indication that Edge uses this.
 

## Dependencies
 1. openpyxl
 2. leveldb (if using helpful repositories)
 3. PyQt5 (if using helpful repositories)

## Notable file paths (Ubuntu 22.04)
1. ~/.config/google-chrome/\<profile\>/Cookies
2. /snap/firefox/common/.mozilla/firefox/\<profile\>.default/
3. ~/.config/google-chrome/\<profile\>/LocalStorage
4. ~/.config/microsoft-edge/\<profile\>/LocalStorage

## evercookie.py useage
 1. All scripts are written for Ubuntu file system.
 2. All scripts are written for one profile/user.
 3. Chromium related browsers were installed with dpkg
 4. Firefox was installed with snap
 5. Review each script before first runtime and make changes as needed.
 6. evercookie.py needs to be run as sudo if you want LocalShareObjectFinder.py to have permissions to check everywhere for LSO objects. Otherwise, its just looking for user LSO objects.

## Helpful Repositories
1. [markmckinnon/Leveldb-py](https://github.com/markmckinnon/Leveldb-py) - LevelDB viewer and dumper
